			<p>The liger is a hybrid cross between a male lion (Panthera leo) and a tigress 
			(Panthera tigris). Thus, it has parents with the same genus but of different species. 
			It is distinct from the similar hybrid tigon. It is the largest of all known extant felines.</p>

			<p>Ligers enjoy swimming, which is a characteristic of tigers, and are very sociable like lions. 
			Ligers exist only in captivity because the habitats of the parental species do not overlap in the wild.
			Historically, when the Asiatic Lion was prolific, the territories of lions and tigers did overlap 
			and there are legends of ligers existing in the wild. Notably, ligers typically grow larger than 
			either parent species, unlike tigons which tend to be about as large as a female tiger.</p>
